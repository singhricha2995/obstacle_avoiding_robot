# obstacle_avoiding_robot
Obstacle Avoiding Robot will automatically sense the obstacle and overcome it on its path. the development and implementation involves movement of the robot moving in the forward direction until there is no object or obstacle detected in the path. Once the obstacle is detected the robot will move sideways either in left direction or right randomly to avoid collision. When the object is detected the servo motor arm will change its direction either left or right. If there is no object the servo motor arm will remain in the forward direction.
